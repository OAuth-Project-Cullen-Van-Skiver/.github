The research performed addresses the need to strengthen web application security and harden Identity and Access Management (IAM) processes by implementing advanced authentication mechanisms. A successful authentication mechanism safeguards user credentials while providing a seamless interaction between the end user and the web application at hand. The project's core objective was to implement an OAuth code flow within the Flask framework and utilize Google as an identity provider. The project involved the use of Googleâ€™s Cloud Console in conjunction with the python based web framework Flask to create a robust and secure authentication mechanism that enables web applications to use third parties, like Google, to authenticate users on behalf of web applications.  Flow diagrams illustrating the OAuth code flow authentication process were crafted to visually depict the authentication process and exchange of information between key components of the mechanism. Implementation of such flow diagrams resulted in successful user authentication via Google credentials. Additional security measures were embedded throughout the program to mitigate potential vulnerabilities and ensure greater data protection. The outcomes of the project emphasize the efficiency and security hardening capabilities behind OAuth user authentication, serving as a model for enhancing web application security while keeping the overall user experience in mind. By leveraging flask and OAuth code flows with Google as an identity provider, this research underlines the importance of strengthened authentication mechanisms and provides valuable insights, frameworks, and implementation techniques for developers aiming to secure the web.
